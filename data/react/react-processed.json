    "answer": [
      "The history of ReactJS started in 2010 with the creation of **XHP**. XHP is a PHP extension which improved the syntax of the language such that XML document fragments become valid PHP expressions and the primary purpose was used to create custom and reusable HTML elements.",
      "The main principle of this extension was to make front-end code easier to understand and to help avoid cross-site scripting attacks. The project was successful to prevent the malicious content submitted by the scrubbing user.",
      "But there was a different problem with XHP in which dynamic web applications require many roundtrips to the server, and XHP did not solve this problem. Also, the whole UI was re-rendered for small change in the application. Later, the initial prototype of React is created with the name **FaxJ** by Jordan inspired from XHP. Finally after sometime React has been introduced as a new library into JavaScript world.",
      "**Note:** JSX comes from the idea of XHP"

      "A `key` is a special attribute you **should** include when creating arrays of elements. _Key_ prop helps React identify which items have changed, are added, or are removed.",
      "Keys should be unique among its siblings. Most often we use ID from our data as _key_:",

    "question": "How to create refs?",
    "answer": [
      "There are two approaches",
      "This is a recently added approach. _Refs_ are created using `React.createRef()` method and attached to React elements via the `ref` attribute. In order to use _refs_ throughout the component, just assign the _ref_ to the instance property within constructor.",

      "If you worked with React before, you might be familiar with an older API where the `ref` attribute is a string, like `ref={'textInput'}`, and the DOM node is accessed as `this.refs.textInput`. We advise against it because _string refs have below issues_, and are considered legacy. String refs were **removed in React v16**.",
      "They _force React to keep track of currently executing component_. This is problematic because it makes react module stateful, and thus causes weird errors when react module is duplicated in the bundle.",

The main difference is that relay only manages state originated from the server, and all access to the state is used via _GraphQL_ queries (for reading data) and mutations (for changing data).

It means that you decorate your component by wrapping it into a Higher-Order component. By wrapping, you can inject additional props or make other changes, which can cause changing logic of rendering. It does not actually enable hijacking, but by using HOC you make your component behave differently."

    "question": "What is a wrapper component?",
    "answer": [
      "A wrapper in React is a component that wraps or surrounds another component or group of components. It can be used for a variety of purposes such as adding additional functionality, styling, or layout to the wrapped components.",
      "For example, consider a simple component that displays a message:",
      "```javascript\nconst Message = ({ text }) => {\n  return <p>{text}</p>;\n};\n\n```",
      "We can create a wrapper component that will add a border to the message component:",
      "```javascript\nconst MessageWrapper = (props) => {\n  return (\n    <div style={{ border: \"1px solid black\" }}>\n      <Message {...props} />\n    </div>\n  );\n};\n\n```",
      "Now we can use the MessageWrapper component instead of the Message component and the message will be displayed with a border:",
      "```javascript\n<MessageWrapper text=\"Hello World\" />\n\n```",
      "Wrapper component can also accept its own props and pass them down to the wrapped component, for example, we can create a wrapper component that will add a title to the message component:",
      "```javascript\nconst MessageWrapperWithTitle = ({title, ...props}) => {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <h3>{title}</h3>\n      <Message {...props} />\n    </div>\n  );\n};\n\n```",
      "Now we can use the MessageWrapperWithTitle component and pass title props:",
      "```javascript\n<MessageWrapperWithTitle title=\"My Message\" text=\"Hello World\" />\n\n```",
      "This way, the wrapper component can add additional functionality, styling, or layout to the wrapped component while keeping the wrapped component simple and reusable."

    "question": "What are the differences between Functional and Class Components?",
    "answer": [
      "There are two different ways to create components in ReactJS. The main differences are listed down as below,",
      "1.  Syntax:",
      "The classs components uses ES6 classes to create the components. It uses `render` function to display the HTML content in the webpage.",
      "The syntax for class component looks like as below.",
      "```js\nclass App extends Reacts.Component {\n  render(){\n    return <h1>This is a class component</h1>}\n  }\n\n\n```",
      "**Note:** The **Pascal Case** is the recommended approach to provide naming to a component.",
      "Functional component has been improved over the years with some added features like Hooks. Here is a syntax for functional component.",
      "```js\nfunction App(){\n  return <div className=\"App\">\n    <h1>Hello, I'm a function component</h1>\n    </div>\n}\n\n\n```",
      "State contains information or data about a component which may change over time.",
      "In class component, you can update the state when a user interacts with it or server updates the data using the `setState()` method. The initial state is going to be assigned in the `Constructor( ) `method using the the ` this.state` object and it is possible to different data types in the `this.state` object such as string, boolean, numbers, etc.\n**A simple example showing how we use the setState() and constructor()**",
      "```js\nclass App extends Component {\n  constructor() {\n    super();\n    this.state = {\n      message: \"This is a class component\",\n    };\n  }\n  updateMessage() {\n    this.setState({t\n      message: \"Updating the class component\",\n    });\n  }\n  render() {\n    return (\n      <>\n        <h1>{this.state.message}</h1>\n        <button\n          onClick={() => {\n            this.updateMessage();\n          }}>\n          Click!!\n        </button>\n      </>\n    );\n  }\n}\n\n\n```",
      "You not use state in functional components because it was only supported in class components. But over the years hooks have been implemented in functional component which enable to use state in functional component too.",
      "The `useState()` hook can used to implement state in funcitonal component. It returns an array with two items: the first item is current state and the next one is a function (setState) that updates the value of the current state.",
      "Let's see an example to demonstrate the state in functional components,",
      "```js\nfunction App() {\n  const [message, setMessage] = useState(\"This is a functional component\");\n  const updateMessage = () => {\n    setCountry(\"Updating the functional component\");\n  };\n  return (\n    <div className=\"App\">\n      <h1>{message} </h1>\n      <button onClick={updateMessage}>Click me!!</button>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\n```",
      "Props are referred to as \"properties\". The props are passed into react component just like arguments passed to a function. In otherwords, they are similar to HTML attributes.",
      "The props are accessible in child class component using `this.props` as shown in below example,",
      "```js\nclass Child extends React.Component {\n  render() {\n    return <h1> This is a functional component and component name is {this.props.name} </h1>;\n  }\n}\n\nclass Parent extends React.Component {\n  render() {\n         return (\n            <div className=\"Parent\">\n            <Child name=\"First child component\" />\n            <Child name=\"Second child component\" />\n            </div>\n          );\n   }\n}\n\n```",
      "Props in functional components are similar to that of the class components but the difference is the absence of 'this' keyword.",
      "```js\nfunction Child(props) {\n  return <h1>This is a child component and the component name is{props.name}</h1>;\n}\n\nfunction Parent() {\n  return (\n    <div className=\"Parent\">\n          <Child name=\"First child component\" />\n          <Child name=\"Second child component\" />\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\n```"

    "answer": [
      "StrictMode renders components twice in development mode(not production) in order to detect any problems with your code and warn you about those problems. This is used to detect accidental side effects in the render phase.  If you used `create-react-app` development tool then it automatically enables StrictMode by default.",
