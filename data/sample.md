It is possible to check if a variable is an array instance using 3 different ways,

**Array.isArray() method:**---

The `Array.isArray(value)` utility function is used to determine whether value is an array or not. This function returns
a true boolean value if the variable is an array and a false value if it is not.

```javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3];
const user = { name: 'John' };
Array.isArray(numbers);  // true
Array.isArray(user); //false
```

**instanceof operator:**

The instanceof operator is used to check the type of an array at run time. It returns true if the type of a variable is
an Array other false for other type.

```javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3];
const user = { name: 'John' };
console.log(numbers instanceof Array);  // true
console.log(user instanceof Array);  // false
```

---

**Checking constructor type:**
The constructor property of the variable is used to determine whether the variable Array type or not.

```javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3];
const user = { name: 'John' };
console.log(numbers.constructor === Array);  // true
console.log(user.constructor === Array);  // false
```
